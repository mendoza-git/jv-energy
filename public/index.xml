This move is part of Irving&amp;rsquo;s broader strategy to accommodate population growth while fostering sustainable urban development.&#xA;The new residential zone will focus on mixed-use developments, seamlessly integrating housing, retail, and community spaces. This approach not only enhances quality of life but also supports local businesses by creating walkable neighborhoods with increased foot traffic.</description>
