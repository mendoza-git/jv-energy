In a groundbreaking move, Fort Worth has passed a series of laws designed to empower small business owners and fuel local economic growth. The measures include streamlined permitting processes, tax incentives for startups, and expanded access to city-funded grants for business development.

These laws aim to lower the barriers to entry for entrepreneurs while supporting existing small businesses in scaling their operations. Fort Worth’s leadership recognizes the critical role small businesses play in creating jobs and driving innovation, making this initiative a key priority for the city’s economic future.

For small business owners and investors, this is an exciting development. The new laws not only provide immediate financial benefits but also establish a more business-friendly environment in the long term. At JAO, we’re committed to helping our clients navigate these opportunities and leverage the support available to achieve their business goals.
